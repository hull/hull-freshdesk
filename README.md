## Overview

Hull Connector for Freshdesk

This connector allows you to synchronize Hull Users with Freshdesk Contacts and Hull Accounts with Freshdesk Companies in both ways.
Furthermore, it enables you to fetch tickets from Freshdesk into Hull Events.

Please refer to the end-user documentation for further details, see [Connector Docs](./assets/readme.md).

## Usage

After installing dependencies via

```console
npm i
```

you can use the `build` script from `package.json` to build the JS files or start the live development server running

```console
npm run start-src--watch
```

For convenience the script section contains a script to run `ngrok` and provide a tunnel to your local environment. Make sure to have [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) installed and then run

```console
npm run ngrok
```

If you are not on a paid ngrok plan, you can run `ngrokfree` which doesn't use a dedicated subdomain.

To run a clustered version of the connector for production, use

```console
npm run start
```

This will use [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) with the parameters specified in [ecosystem.config.js](./ecosystem.config.js). For more information about the Ecosystem File, see the [PM2 Documentation](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/#ecosystem-file).
