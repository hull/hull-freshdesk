# Developing Guidelines

## Git Flow

This project follows [Vincent Driessen's branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and uses Git Flow.
Please make sure that you understand the model and commit to the proper branch.
If you have any questions, [open a ticket](https://github.com/hull/hull-freshdesk/issues/new) and discuss it with the maintainers.
